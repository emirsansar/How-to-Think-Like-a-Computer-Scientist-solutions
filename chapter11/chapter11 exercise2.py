#Consider this fragment of code:

#import turtle
#tess = turtle.Turtle()
#alex = tess
#alex.color("hotpink")

# Does this fragment create one or two turtle instances? Does setting the color of alex also change the color of tess? Explain in detail.


""" Alex and Tess are two different turtles with the same computer. """
